# Annoying Creepers

NOTE: This plugin has been designed to work with 1.16.x! It may or will not work with other versions.

Thank you for downloading Annoying Creepers! This plugin is mean't for fun.

If you do not know how to install plugins, please follow this short guide:
1. Ensure you have a spigot server and also ensure its not running.
2. Drag and drop the plugin file into the plugins folder.
3. Start your server and the plugin should start automatically.

To those with less powerful computers: This plugin does not have a max explosion size, meaning it will double the size until 32 bit integer limit as minecraft cannot handle past that number.

Enjoy!
